title:  "A short project's overview"

The Hype Forever project consists of several parts. In this post, I want to give
a short chronological overview about its structure.

# Website

[hypeforever.webs.com](http://hypeforever.webs.com) is the official website of
this project. Originally created in 2009, it recently got a design refresh by
NeoMoonlighter & is one of the top Google results if you search for Hype: The
Time Quest.

It features a lot of interesting information about the game, including the
soundtrack, pictures, videos and an active forum.

# Facebook

There's also an official Facebook group
([facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/groups/126929554163825)). If you look
at the content, it's quite similar to the website. Even some members of the
original Hype development team visit the group from time to time.

# Game

The Hype Forever team is currently actively working on a remake of the original
Hype: The Time Quest game. It's still in a very early stage and the progress
will be posted on this blog.

The game will use Unity ([unity3d.com](http://unity3d.com)) as its engine and
will be available for Windows, OS X and Linux.

# Blog

This blog started in 2016. It's based on the static page generator Jekyll
([jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com)) and is hosted on GitHub
([github.com](https://github.com/hypeforever/blog)). Feel free to create a pull
request on GitHub if you find a mistake!

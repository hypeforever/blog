It took quite a long time, but finally our first model is done. It's a small
building, located at the entrance of Torras.

The source files are hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/hypeforever/models),
just like everything else of this project.


# Original model

On the following screenshot, you can see the original model. It's the building
on the left.

The screenshot is taken from Frogoggy's awesome [Let's Play](https://youtu.be/H6LZHPSPK1Q)!

# New model

The new model consists of ~4,500 triangles. In Unity, it uses three materials
(wood, glas & walls/etc). The screenshots are ingame screenshots.
